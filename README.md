coding challenge for secret company



For build use the application you will need

1 Java 17 +
2 Maven installed



For start backend use
```
mvn clean build
mvn spring-boot:run
```


for start front-end use 
```
cd ./frontend/coding-challenge/
npm install
npm start
```


assumptions:

1 System will have media werehause, so backend will just contains link for the image

2 System will not provide any security aspects 

3 System provide "fake" data storing level

4 The solution will provide maven as a build system and instruction for build the project on backend
